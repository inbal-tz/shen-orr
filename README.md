<h1> Predicting Human Gene Expression of non One–To–One Orthologs </h1>
Accuratly predicting human gene expression using mouse data can enable a more efficient process to drug development, and save a great deal of time and money.

This addition to Found In Translation (FIT) algorithm enables the prediction of human gene expression, given mouse gene expression of non one-to-one ortholgs.
I Used lasso regression using all of the mouse orthologs to predict the human gene expression.
The prediction was found better than using the indivisual mouse orthologs, and better than using spearman correlation with each individual mouse ortholog.
